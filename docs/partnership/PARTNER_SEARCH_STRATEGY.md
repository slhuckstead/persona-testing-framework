# Partner Search Strategy - Multi-Dimensional Persona Testing Framework
**Inventor/Founder:** Seth Huckstead
**Role:** Visionary, Product Strategy, Business Development
**Seeking:** Technical Co-Founder / Engineering Partner

---

## 🎯 Your Role vs Partner's Role

### What You Bring (Critical Value)
- ✅ **The Invention** - Novel framework concept (IP you own)
- ✅ **Domain Expertise** - Real-world UX/testing pain points
- ✅ **Product Vision** - Know what users need
- ✅ **Business Strategy** - Path 3 hybrid model
- ✅ **Problem Definition** - Deep understanding of testing landscape
- ✅ **User Perspective** - Can evaluate if solution actually works
- ✅ **Partnership/BD** - Connect with academic/industry partners

### What Partner Brings
- 🔧 **Technical Implementation** - Actually build the thing
- 🔧 **Architecture** - Design scalable system
- 🔧 **AI/ML Expertise** - Implement agent behaviors
- 🔧 **DevOps** - Deploy and maintain
- 🔧 **Open Source Community** - Manage GitHub, issues, PRs

### Equity Split (Industry Standard for Idea + Engineer)
**Recommended: 50/50 split**
- You: Inventor, CEO/CPO (Chief Product Officer), owns IP
- Partner: CTO (Chief Technology Officer), builds product
- Both: Co-founders with equal stake

**Why 50/50 is fair:**
- Ideas without execution = $0
- Execution without novel idea = commodity
- Together = valuable company
- Equal partnership = equal commitment

**Alternative splits if you contribute more:**
- 60/40 (you/them) if you: raise money, do sales, manage business
- 55/45 if you: contribute some funding, have customers lined up
- 70/30 only if you: have funding, customers, AND they're employee not partner

**Red flags:**
- ❌ "I'll build it for 10% equity" - They don't believe in it
- ❌ "You're just the idea person, I want 70%" - Doesn't respect you
- ❌ "Let's start, we'll figure out equity later" - Always fails

## 👥 Ideal Partner Profile

### Technical Skills Required
**Must Have:**
- ✅ TypeScript/JavaScript (your stack)
- ✅ AI/ML experience (agent simulation)

- ✅ Full-stack development (can ship complete product)

**Nice to Have:**
- React/Next.js (your current stack)
- Python (for ML components)

Title: Seeking Technical Co-Founder - Novel UX Testing Framework

Background: I've invented a novel approach to automated UX testing using
AI personas across three dimensions (expert, user, cultural). Patent pending.

The Problem: Current UX testing is manual ($80/user), slow (days), and
Western-centric. Companies expanding internationally struggle with
cultural adaptation.

The Solution: AI agents that simulate specific user personas (elderly users,
cultural differences, cognitive diversity) and provide improvement
suggestions based on pattern recognition.

Market: $2B+ UX testing market, growing 15% annually

Traction: Framework specified, initial implementation, academic interest

Seeking: Full-stack engineer with AI/ML experience who:
- Wants to solve real problem, not just build another SaaS
- Comfortable with open source + commercial hybrid model
- Respects non-technical co-founders
- Excited about HCI/UX research

Offering: 50/50 co-founder equity, CEO/CTO partnership

Background check: Happy to share references, sign mutual NDA for details
```

1. **Twitter/X:**
   - Follow: #buildinpublic, #indiehackers hashtags
   - Post: "Looking for technical co-founder"
   - DM people who tweet about testing/UX

2. **LinkedIn:**
   - Post: Seeking technical co-founder
   - Search: "Full stack engineer" + "Open to opportunities"
   - Engage with posts in Testing/QA communities

3. **Dev.to:**

## 📄 Materials You Need (Create Before Partner Search)

### 1. One-Page Summary (Non-Technical)
```
MULTI-DIMENSIONAL PERSONA TESTING FRAMEWORK

The Problem:
UX testing is expensive ($80/user), slow (days), and misses cultural
differences. 90% of products fail in international markets due to poor
cultural adaptation.

- Users from different cultures (Chinese, Indian, American)
- Users with cognitive diversity (ADHD, dyslexia)

Agents perform pattern recognition and suggest improvements.

The Innovation:
First framework to combine expert testing, user behavior simulation,
and cultural adaptation in one automated system.

Market Opportunity:
- $2B UX testing market
- $500M+ cultural localization market
- Every SaaS company expanding internationally

Status:
- Framework specified (100+ pages)
- Initial proof of concept
- Patent pending (provisional filed)
- Academic interest (3 university contacts)

Team:
- Seeking: Technical co-founder (CTO)
- Offering: 50/50 equity split
- Business model: Open source + hosted SaaS

Contact: [Your email]
Status: Patent Pending - NDA required for details

   - Too many steps?
4. Show the persona profiles you've written
5. Explain the pattern recognition concept

**Keep it simple:**
- Don't pretend to be technical
- Focus on "what" not "how"
- Let partner figure out "how"
- Your expertise: Is this actually valuable to users?

## 🤝 Vetting Potential Partners

### First Conversation (30 min)

**Your goals:**
1. Do they understand the problem?
2. Are they excited about it?
3. Do they respect your role?
4. Can they explain technical concepts simply?

**Questions to ask:**
1. "What's your background in testing/UX?"
2. "What excites you about this problem?"
3. "How would you approach building this?"
4. "What concerns do you have?"
5. "What's your experience with open source?"
6. "Have you done a startup before?"
7. "What's your ideal working relationship?"

**Red flags:**
- "This is easy, I can build in a weekend" (oversimplifying)
- "Ideas don't matter" (won't respect your input)
- "Let me take this and think about it" (might build alone)
- Can't explain things simply (won't be good collaborator)

**Green flags:**
- Asks lots of questions about the problem
- Suggests improvements to your framework
- Talks about "we" not "I"
- Proposes working agreement upfront
- Shares their own ideas openly

### Second Meeting (After NDA Signed)

**Share:**
- Full specification documents
- Technical requirements
- Roadmap and timeline
- Business model details

**Discuss:**
- Division of responsibilities
- Equity split
- Vesting schedule (4 years, 1 year cliff)
- Decision-making process
- IP assignment

### Trial Period (Before Committing)

**Option:** 1-month paid trial
- Pay: $3,000-5,000 for month
- Deliverable: Architecture document + proof of concept
- Both evaluate: Do we work well together?

**If works well:** Convert to equity partnership
**If doesn't work:** Part ways, you own the code

---

## 📋 Partnership Agreement Essentials

### What to Include (Get Attorney to Draft)

**1. Equity Split**
- You: 50%, vesting over 4 years
- Partner: 50%, vesting over 4 years
- 1-year cliff (if quit in first year, get nothing)

**2. Roles & Responsibilities**
- You: CEO, Product, Business Development, Fundraising
- Partner: CTO, Engineering, Technical Architecture

**3. IP Assignment**
- Partner assigns all work to company
- You assign framework IP to company
- Both sign: "All work belongs to company"

**4. Decision Making**
- Major decisions: Both must agree (deadlock = outside arbitrator)
- Day-to-day: Each owns their domain

**5. Vesting**
- 4-year vesting, 25% per year
- 1-year cliff (nothing if leave before 1 year)
- Accelerates if company acquired

**6. Exit Scenarios**
- If one quits: Equity stops vesting
- If fired: Depends on cause (with/without cause)
- If company fails: Equity worthless (that's startup risk)

**Cost:** $2,000-5,000 for attorney to draft
**Worth it:** Prevents 90% of co-founder conflicts

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Sharing before NDA**
- Always get NDA signed first
- Even if they seem trustworthy
- Protects both of you

**Mistake 2: Verbal agreements**
- Everything in writing
- Equity, roles, decisions
- "Let's figure it out later" = failure

**Mistake 3: Unequal partnership with "boss" mentality**
- You're partners, not boss/employee
- Respect their expertise
- Listen to technical concerns

**Mistake 4: Rushing due to excitement**
- Date before marrying
- Work together 1-2 months before equity
- Co-founder breakup is worst startup killer

**Mistake 5: Choosing friend over qualified partner**
- Friend with wrong skills = failed startup + lost friendship
- Better: Qualified stranger who becomes friend
