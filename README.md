# Multi-Dimensional Persona Testing Framework

**"What can happen, will happen" - Comprehensive automated UX testing**

**Inventor:** Seth Huckstead
**Status:** Patent Pending (Provisional filing in progress)
**Date:** February 2026

---

## Overview

A novel AI-driven testing framework that simulates how real humans interact with software across three dimensions:

1. **Expert Personas** - Security experts, DevOps engineers, Accessibility specialists finding technical issues
2. **User Personas** - Real human archetypes (elderly users, tech-anxious, power users) testing for UX issues
3. **Cultural Personas** - Users from different cultures with different expectations and interaction patterns

## The Innovation

**First framework to combine:**
- ✅ Expert testing + User behavior simulation + Cultural adaptation
- ✅ AI-driven automation (not manual, not dumb bots)
- ✅ Pattern recognition (not just pass/fail)
- ✅ Improvement suggestions (not just bug reports)

**Novel approach:**
- Agents observe interaction patterns across sessions
- Identify what confuses users, what causes hesitation
- Suggest specific improvements with predicted impact
- Example: *"Button says 'Delete' - caused 10s anxiety. Change to 'Remove' or add 'You can undo this' → Reduces anxiety 60%"*

- ✅ Expert personas implemented (Security, DevOps agents)
- ✅ 55+ test scenarios created
- ✅ Proof of concept on real application
- ✅ Academic interest (potential CHI publication)

**In Progress:**
- 🔄 Provisional patent filing (February 2026)
- 🔄 User persona implementation
- 🔄 Pattern recognition algorithms

**Next 6 Months:**
- Full persona implementation
- Validation study with real users
- Research paper submission (CHI conference)
- MVP hosted service launch

## Business Model

**Hybrid: Open Source + Commercial Hosting** (Path 3)

- **Open Source:** Framework and core personas (GitHub) - builds community and adoption
- **Commercial SaaS:** PersonaTest.ai - Hosted service with free tier and enterprise plans

**Revenue projections:**
- Year 1: 100 paying customers = $240K ARR
- Year 2: 500 customers = $1.2M ARR
- Year 3: 2,000 customers = $4.8M ARR

## Market Opportunity

**Total Addressable Market: $5B+**
- UX testing market: $2B (growing 15%/year)
- Cultural localization: $500M+
- Accessibility testing: $300M+

**Target customers:**
- SaaS companies expanding internationally
- Enterprise software with diverse users
- E-commerce platforms (cultural adaptation)
- Government/healthcare (accessibility requirements)

## Competitive Advantage

| PersonaTest.ai | UserTesting.com | Selenium | Design Personas |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Speed** | Instant | Days | Instant | N/A |
| **Cost** | $199/mo | $80/tester | Free | Free |
| **Cultural** | ✅ Automated | ✅ Manual | ❌ None | ✅ Design only |
| **Scale** | Unlimited | Budget-limited | No insight | Not testing |
| **Insight** | Pattern-based | Real feedback | Pass/fail | Hypothetical |

**Why we win:** 10x cheaper than manual testing, 100x more insightful than automation, culturally comprehensive.
